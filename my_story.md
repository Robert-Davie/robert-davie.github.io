*My Journey to Coding*

During sixth form I spent a large amount of time preparing to apply for medical school. I was pretty determined to achieve high grades and take part in extra-curricular activities in order to give myself the best possible chance. I volunteered at a local retirement home where I learned how to communicate with people, studied tirelessly to achieve high grades and carefully practised my interview techniques so I knew how to present myself. Despite achieving excellent grades - A*AAAA, the only student in my year to have completed 5 A levels, no university was willing to take me on board.

I applied again the following year and during that time I worked for a local company called Simutec Systems which specialized in simulation software and communications devices - here I was introduced to python in the workplace for the first time, though my interactions with the python code were minimal it gave me the drive to continue to learn about this language. My gap year had been a success as I was given a place to study at Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry - I finally had the opportunity to become a doctor.

Unfortunately I found that I wasn't particularly suited to medicine.
